# Bad Bank 

Bad Bank is a full-stack banking app which features the front-end JavaScript library, <b>ReactJS</b> and allows for data to be stored with <b>MongoDB</b>. This simple site is a great, effective way for new developers to experience the entirety of an application that is functional and able to generate and store information.

## Installation

Clone the Bad Bank application by getting the local HTTPS URL from the green <b><> Code</b> button in the upper right section of the code. In your terminal run <b>git clone <REPOSITORY HTTPS URL></b>. From here, enter the editor (run <b>code .</b> in directory) and start a local server by <i>either</i> running <b>node index.js</b> or <b>http-server</b> in the terminal.


## Technology Used

Bad Bank utilizes JavaScript-compatible tools for its production. 

<b>ReactJS</b> is the foundation for the application's front-end. Bootstrap elements such as a <b>NavBar</b>, <b>Cards</b> and <b>Input</b> fields are also heavily utilized in the user interface. 

<b>Express</b> and <b>Cors</b> are used to access the server (see <i>./index.js</i> for requirements and specific API calls).

<b>MongoDB</b> is where the generated data is stored. I have been using it in relation as a <b>Docker</b> container and <b>Studio 3T</b> for additional manipulation. 


## More Features

The current features for Bad Bank include allowing a user to create an account where they can deposit and withdraw money, where there balance is updated as transactions are made, and where their personal information is secure. 

Moving forward, I hope to include more variety and security. 
I will add a <b>password clue</b> menu, for scenarios where the user forgets theirs, as well as a <b>password reset</b> feature where the user is sent an email with a confirmation code and link to reset their password for whatever reason. 
Additionally, I would like to add more functionality like loans, insurance, and other such factors that take into consideration regular billing, interest rates and credit adjustments.
